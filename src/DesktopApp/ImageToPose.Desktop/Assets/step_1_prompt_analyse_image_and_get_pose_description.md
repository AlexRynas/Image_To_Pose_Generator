USER-SET ANCHORS
[USER_ANCHORS] Left hand=<what it’s touching/doing>; Right hand=<...>; Left foot=<...>; Right foot=<...>; Facing=<left/right/¾/profile>; Notes=<optional>

TASK
From one user-provided photo with a single person, describe the pose in concise natural language (no lists, no JSON).

LATERALITY LOCK (MANDATORY)
1) If [USER_ANCHORS] is present, COPY it into [ANCHORS] verbatim.
   If absent, infer anchors from the image.
2) Perform a left↔right swap test; only continue if your anchors would read worse after swapping.
3) If [USER_ANCHORS] is present and seems to conflict with the image, write Check=FLAG and still use USER_ANCHORS, adding a one-clause note of the conflict.

OUTPUT (exactly two blocks)
[ANCHORS] Left hand=?, Right hand=?, Left foot=?, Right foot?, Facing=?, Check=PASS|FLAG
[POSE] One paragraph (4–6 sentences, ≤140 words) covering: camera/view; global stance & lean; head/neck (yaw/pitch/tilt); torso orientation/lean/side-bend; each shoulder/arm (flexion/abduction/protraction), elbow bend, forearm rotation; hands (gesture + palm orientation); hips/legs/knees/feet/ankles; brief occlusions/uncertainties.

RULES
- Use the subject’s anatomical left/right only.
- Prefer “uncertain” over guessing when occluded.
- Plain terms with optional angles (e.g., “about 30°”).
- No identity/appearance judgments.
